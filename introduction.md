<h1>Day 1 - What is Programming and Python?</h1>
<h2>What is Programming</h2>
<p>Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation.
If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11.
How about 23453453 X 56456?</p>
<p>You will start searching for a calculator or jump to a new tab to calculate the same.
This 100 days of code series will help you learn python from starting to the end. We will start from 0 and by the time we end this course, I promise you will be a Job ready Python developer!</p>
<h2>What is Python?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python is a dynamically typed, general purpose programming language that supports an object-oriented programming approach as well as a functional programming approach.</li>
<li>Python is an interpreted and a high-level programming language.</li>
<li>It was created by Guido Van Rossum in 1989.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Features of Python</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python is simple and easy to understand.</li>
<li>It is Interpreted and platform-independent which makes debugging very easy.</li>
<li>Python is an open-source programming language.</li>
<li>Python provides very big library support. Some of the popular libraries include NumPy, Tensorflow, Selenium, OpenCV, etc.</li>
<li>It is possible to integrate other programming languages within python.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What is Python used for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python is used in Data Visualization to create plots and graphical representations.</li>
<li>Python helps in Data Analytics to analyze and understand raw data for insights and trends.</li>
<li>It is used in AI and Machine Learning to simulate human behavior and to learn from past data without hard coding.</li>
<li>It is used to create web applications.</li>
<li>It can be used to handle databases.</li>
<li>It is used in business and accounting to perform complex mathematical operations along with quantitative and qualitative analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Replit?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replit is very easy to share tutorials and code.</li>
<li>You can easily fork this repl and continue learning in your own style. Video, code as well as text tutorial on the same page which makes things easy!</li>
<li>For fellow teachers out there, you create a .tutorial folder to create tutorials using replit.</li>
</ul>
